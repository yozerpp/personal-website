    "about_text": "I'm a software engineering graduate focused on full-stack web development. As an enthusiast of web development, designing and implementing software systems at each layer of their abstraction intrigue me. My project 'E-Commerce Sandbox' is an instance where I designed and implemented each layer of the application from domain model to UI. Machine learning and image processing are also among the fields that I studied and developed projects in. My project 'Nut Classifier' is a project i developed in this field.\n\nIn addition to my hard skills, my internships helped me improve my soft skills like team cooperation and project management (Scrum). I've improved my teamwork in Biltaş Group, where I cooperated with my lead developer and other developers to design, develop and test a companion app for their systems. And I learned about project management and software development methodologies like Scrum and Agile in my internship at Kivi e-Dönüşüm.",
